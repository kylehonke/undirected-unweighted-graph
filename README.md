COSC 2436 Final Project: Graphs

This program will:
- Create a working undirected unweighted graph class with all the standard methods for a data structure of that type.
- Work with a struct data type called Data. The struct data type contains an int called id and a string called information.

The graph is implemented using the adjacency matrix approach.
The 2D vector 'adjacencyMatrix' stores the edges between nodes, allowing the graph to grow/ shrink to any size.
